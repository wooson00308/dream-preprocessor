*Keep Claude alive between sessions.*

Claude Code is reactive — it only works when you talk to it.
Heartbeat makes it proactive.

A lightweight daemon that periodically wakes Claude on schedule, runs skills, and goes back to sleep. Zero token cost when idle.

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  HEARTBEAT  │     │   condition  │     │  claude -p  │
│  .md        │────►│   check      │────►│  "{prompt}" │
│ (job config)│     │  (shell cmd) │     │ (skill run) │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └─────────────┘
                      skip if nothing        wake only
                      to do (cost: 0)        when needed
```

## How it works

1. Heartbeat daemon runs in the background (via launchd)
2. Every 60 seconds, it checks configured jobs
3. For each job whose interval has elapsed, it runs a condition check
4. If the condition passes, it wakes Claude with `claude -p "{prompt}"`
5. Claude executes the skill and goes back to sleep

The daemon never calls the LLM itself. It only decides when to wake it.

## What can you run?

The `prompt` field accepts anything — a plain sentence, a skill command, or a reference to documentation. Heartbeat doesn't care what the prompt says. It just passes it to `claude -p`.

### Plain prompts

```markdown
## daily-summary
- slug: -Users-yourname-Git-myproject
- prompt: Check git log for the last 24 hours and summarize changes
- interval: 1d
- timeout: 5m

## lint-check
- slug: -Users-yourname-Git-myproject
- prompt: Run npm run lint and fix any errors
- interval: 6h
- timeout: 3m
```

### Skills

Claude Code supports [user-created skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) — reusable prompts that Claude can execute on demand. For more complex or multi-step tasks, you can write a skill and reference it in the prompt field.

The `dream` skill is included as a working example.

```bash
heartbeat skills              # List available skills
heartbeat install dream       # Install a skill
```

### dream (example skill)

Automatically consolidates session transcripts into long-term memory. Claude Code saves every conversation as JSONL, but never reads them again. The dream skill processes these transcripts and updates memory so the next session starts with full context.

See [skills/dream/README.md](skills/dream/README.md) for details.

## Prerequisites

- macOS (launchd-based automation)
- Python 3.11+
- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install claude-heartbeat

# Install the dream skill (copies SKILL.md + registers heartbeat jobs)
heartbeat install dream

# Verify
heartbeat jobs

# Test run
heartbeat once

# Start daemon
heartbeat start
```

For launchd registration and detailed setup, see the [Setup Guide](docs/setup.md).

## Configuration

Jobs are defined in `~/.claude/HEARTBEAT.md`:

```markdown
# HEARTBEAT

- tick: 60s

## my-project
- slug: -Users-yourname-Git-myproject
- prompt: /dream
- interval: 3h
- timeout: 10m
- condition: dream-prep status --slug="..." | grep -q "미처리: 0" && exit 1 || exit 0
- notify: all
```


| Field     | Description                                            | Default           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| slug      | Project slug (`~/.claude/projects/` subdirectory name) | Required          |
| prompt    | Prompt passed to `claude -p`                           | Required          |
| interval  | Run interval (s/m/h/d)                                 | 1h                |
| timeout   | Timeout (s/m/h/d)                                      | 600s              |
| condition | Pre-run shell check (exit 0 = run)                     | None (always run) |
| notify    | macOS notification level: `all`, `failure`, `none`     | all               |

Global settings go before any `##` job header:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| tick | Daemon wake interval (s/m/h/d) | 60s |

## CLI

```bash
heartbeat start           # Start daemon (background)
heartbeat start -f        # Foreground mode
heartbeat stop            # Stop daemon
heartbeat status          # Status + job states + recent logs
heartbeat jobs            # List configured jobs
heartbeat once            # Run all jobs once
heartbeat once -j "name"  # Run specific job once
heartbeat skills          # List available skills
heartbeat install <name>  # Install a skill
```

## Migration from v0.1

If you're upgrading from `dream-preprocessor` v0.1:

- `dream-heartbeat` still works as an alias for `heartbeat`
- `dream-prep` still works as before
- No changes needed to your `HEARTBEAT.md` or launchd plist
